# KTaNE utils

A Rust crate providing various utilities related to the [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes] game:

 - generate instances of modules and [edgework]
 - validate or generate the solutions for module instances
 - procedurally generate rule sets compatible with the [Rule Seed Modifier] mod

The library was created for use in the [KTaNE simulator] project, but is available independently
in hope of being useful in any other projects.
