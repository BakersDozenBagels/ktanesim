## Licensing

The code in the `ktane-utils` directory is licensed under either of

As a notable consequence of this fact, should you run a modified version of the bot, **you must
make the modified source code available to everyone who interacts with the bot**. A good way to
do this is to set up the `!source` command to link to your code.
